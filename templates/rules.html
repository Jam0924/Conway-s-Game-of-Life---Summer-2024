        <h1 class = "RulesTitle"> About </h1>
        <!-- Add the about paragraph-->
        <p class = "AboutParagraph"> Conways Game of Life is a program that is meant to simulate how given populations might grow given the certain rules that restrict their population. A simple combination of 3
            cells can become something much larger, while 1 cell on its own will die. Some configurations have the power to repeat forever, or move across the screen, while others have
            the ability to grow indefinitely until it reaches the border of the area. Have fun testing out patterns and configuring the settings to generate new and unique patterns that
            have never been seen before! </p>

        <!-- Create a title for the rules secton of the page-->
        <h1 class = "RulesBody">Rules</h1>
        <p class = "AboutParagraph"> In Conways Game of Life, a cell's fate is decided by its neighboring cells. Whether there are too many, or not enough, a cell's survival or death in the next
            generation depends on its surroundings.
        </p>

        <!-- Use an h2 tag to name the rule and describe how it applies to the game-->
        <h2 class = "RulesBody">Underpopulation</h2>
        <p class = "AboutParagraph"> In Conways Game of Life, if a cell has less than 2 cells adjacent to it, in the next generation that cell will be killed as a result of underpopulation.
            This can be adjusted inside of settings to be any number between 1-8. When populations have a high criteria for underpopulation, the population struggles to grow and will often die
            earlier then populations with a lower underpopulation critera.
        </p>

        <!-- Use an h2 tag to name the rule and describe how it applies to the game-->
        <h2 class = "RulesBody">Overpopulation</h2>
        <p class = "AboutParagraph"> In Conways Game of Life, if a cell has more than 3 cells adjacent to it, in the next generation that cell will die due to overpopulation. This can be adjusted
            in settings to be any number between 1-8. Populations with a high criteria for overpopulation tend to survive longer due to them being able to survive in extremely saturated areas. This
            can result in clusters of cells in one area that may survive over generations. However, populations with a low criteria for overpopulation will strugle to survive, and will tend to be
            sparse and further apart on the grid.
        </p>

        <!-- Use an h2 tag to name the rule and describe how it applies to the game-->
        <h2 class = "RulesBody">Repopulation</h2>
        <p class = "AboutParagraph"> In Conways Game of Life, if a dead cell has exactly 3 cells adjacent to it, in the next generation that cell will come to life. This can be adjusted in settings
            to be any number between 1-8. Populations with a low number of cells needed for repopulation will grow extremely quickly, however depending on the critera for over and under population
            this may not have the same effect. A unique combination of repopulation, overpopulation, and underpopulation settings can create millions of unique patterns.
